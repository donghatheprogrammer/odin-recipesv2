        <ol>
            <li>Wash chicken and pat dry. In a large bowl, stir together buttermilk, garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning and 
                celery seeds. Place chicken in buttermilk mixture and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>In a large frying pan or wok, heat oil to 325 degrees F. Drain chicken in a colander to remove excess buttermilk.
                Place tempura batter mix in a large paper bag; add chicken. Close top and gently shake bag to coat chicken with tempura
                batter mix. Remove chicken and fry, turning piece over after 3 minutes. Continue to fry, turning occasionally until browned
                on all sides
